of
the

while

s
analysis
does
show
a
dewpoint
of

degrees
f
at

it
is
both
my
and
john
handley
s
opinion
that
the
gas
from
the
wellbore
had
stratified
by
the
time
that
this
sample
was
taken
we
expect
the
dewpoint
of
the
flowing
gas
to
be
higher
however
this
was
the
best
sample
that
could
be
obtained
at
the
time
we
have
conferred
with
steve
schneider
and
we
are
willing
to
take
this
gas
on
a
conditional
basis
over
the
next
couple
of
days
once
the
line
has
been
pigged
the
production
flows
stablilized
and
mitchell

equipment
lined
out
over

hms
will
need

have

run
an
extended
analysis
with
a
dewpoint
curve
on
an
expedited
basis
should
this
sample
indicate
a
dewpoint
over
degrees

then
this

be
shut

again
until

dewpoint

zero
path
termination
in
path
manager
matt
ben

i
am
responding
to
your
request
for
comments
on
revising
path
manager
by
expanding
the
parameters
of
the
path
termination
process
to
include
zero
volume
paths
on
the
last
day
of
the
month
as
a
way
to
speed
up
unify
response
and
retrieve
times

based
on
my
interviews
of
various
desks
including
aep
and
calgary
and
our
recent
discussions
we
find
a
legitimate
business
need
to
allow
zero
volume
paths
to
roll
from
month
to
month
requirements
contracts
on
wellhead
gas
following
is
a
recap
of
what
is
proposed
to
be
done
regarding
zero
path
termination

all
paths
that
are
zero
on
the
last
day
of
a
month
exception
noted
in
below
will
terminate
on
that
day
and
will
no
longer
roll
into
the
following
month

this
path
termination
out
function
will
run
every
night
any
paths
changed
to
zero
retroactively
will
zero
out
future
month
s
paths
unless
a
volume
is
on
that
path
in
the
future
month

zero
paths
marked
as
always
send
nominations
will
continue
to
roll
from
month
to
month
until
changed
to
some
other
nomination
option
it
appears
that
hpl
paths
and
nigas
paths
might
have
some
paths
rolling
that
no
longer
need
to
a
special
one
time
handling
of
these
paths
will
be
coordinated
with
the
scheduler
when
you
are
ready

zero
paths
which
roll
from
month
to
month
using
the
volume
management
do
not
send
function
will
cease
to
do
so
this
was
agree
to
by
patti
in
regards
to
paths
for
oba
tracking

all

please
respond
via
e
mail
with
any
comments
